[wearehunnyandthebee.com](http://wearehunnyandthebee.com/) is a site my wife and I designed together to announce our engagement and wedding information. We got engaged and married during 2020 so our in-person celebration was severely limited. This website was a way for us share our joy with our friends and family digitally. The website features a scrollable animated timeline of my relationship with my wife, Hannah.

Technically, this project was interesting to me because I got to experiment more with GSAP, a javascript animation library. I used the tool to create the scroll-based image animations, like moving the characters down the page and fading in elements. The site is deployed to a DigitalOcean droplet I have managed under terraform.
